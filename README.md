- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the overlap between the business world and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in R and Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects! I would love to learn more through working on different projects and I'm open to working with different data sets.
